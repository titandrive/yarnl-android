# Yarnl for Android

[Yarnl](https://yarnl.com) ([GitHub](https://github.com/titandrive/yarnl)) was built from the beginning to be used from the browser, whether on your computer, tablet, or phone. The web app is fully responsive and should work perfectly on whichever device you use it on. As such, this Android app is not necessary at all to enjoy Yarnl.

With that said, if you prefer an Android app for whatever reason, here it is! It is essentially a glorified web wrapper and (currently) provides no real benefit over the web app. It is not in active development and may be abandoned at any time.

If you have any features you would like to see in the app that aren't possible in the web app, please let me know via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/titandrive/yarnl-android/issues).
